In line 29 and 30 the user ask for a number but if this feilds is left empty by the user the user gets and error from the inteprator , 
This needs to be added as an alert to the user to know that this feilds cant be left as empty.

 x = float(input("Enter first number: "))
 y = float(input("Enter second number: "))
